      <h3>We believe access to care should never be a privilege.</h3>
      <p>
        The Care Box Project exists to restore dignity, comfort, and confidence
        through thoughtfully assembled care packages that address essential
        wellness and hygiene needs. Women and marginalized communities are
        disproportionately affected by limited access to basic care, often
        forced to navigate systems that overlook or undervalue their well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded in Bellevue, The Care Box Project began as a local response to a
        widespread and often invisible issue. We believe that access to care
        should never be a privilege, and that essential products — particularly
        those related to women’s health — are fundamental to safety, stability,
        and self-worth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through community-driven outreach and intentional distribution, we aim
        to reduce barriers to care while fostering a sense of dignity and
        support. As we grow, our mission remains rooted in compassion, equity,
        and impact, with the long-term goal of expanding our reach nationally
        and advocating for a future where no one is left without the care they
        deserve.
